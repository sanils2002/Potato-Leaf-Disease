# Potato-Leaf-Disease Predictor 

## Problem Statement:-

### "Every year, farmers face substantial economic losses and crop wastage due to diseases that affect potato plants. Two of the most devastating diseases that afflict potato leaves are Early Blight and Late Blight. These diseases are responsible for significant reductions in potato yields and can lead to severe economic hardship for farmers"

Thus the images are classified into 3 classes :

*  *Healthy leaves*

*  *Late Blight leaves*

## Technology stack used:- 

+ **Tensorflow**
+ **Numpy**
+ **Keras**
+ **Matplotlib**
+ **Pathlib**

## Dataset :-

The dataset is being taken from ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

The dataset contains 15 different directories:-


+ *Potato___Early_blight*

+ *Potato___Late_blight*

+ *Potato___healthy*

each containing images in **.jpg** format.

## Workflow:-

The model accuracy after training the image dataset is > **97%**.
